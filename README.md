A. Replace api-Key and secret-Key that you have received in step 2 or 3 at line number 5 and 6.
B. Replace project-no with your Google Project Number at line number 7.
C. Replace your user-id by which you want to register your application for PushNotification at line number 8.
```
11. Adding Android Native Extension.

```
A. Open Flex Build path and add app42Push.ane file and Native Extension in your Sample project if not added.
B. Open Flex Build packaging by selecting project properties, click on Google Android and select Native Extension and checked your Native Extension added in prior step.
```
11.Build your android application and install on your android device.

__Test and verify PushNotification from AppHQ console__
 
```

```
# Design Details:
__Initializing App42API in ActionScript to send PushNotification :__ To Send PushNotification using APP42 ActionScript API you have to initialize first using Api-Key and Secret-Key written in App42FlashHome.mxml file.
 
```
    private function intializeApi():void
            {
                App42API.initialize(AppConstants.ApiKey,AppConstants.SecretKey);
                App42API.setLoggedInUser(AppConstants.UserId);
                App42Log.setDebug(true);
            }

```

__Registering on GCM for PushNotification in Android:__ To get PushNotification you have to register on GCM using Google Project No written in App42FlashHome.mxml file.
 
```
            app42Push.register(AppConstants.ProjectNo);

```
__Registering Device on App42:__ This function store device token on App42 using ActionScript API ,when we get registration event from Android Native written in App42FlashHome.mxml file.

```
   private function onRegistered(event:App42RegistrationEvent):void
            {
                trace("Registered with registration id:", event.registrationId);
                // Storing registration id received from C2DM service
                persistence.setProperty("registration_id", event.registrationId);
                App42API.buildPushNotificationService().storeDeviceToken(App42API.getLoggedInUser(),
                event.registrationId,DeviceType.ANDROID,new App42FlashCallback());
                registered = true;
            }

```


__Send PushNotification to User using ActionScript App42 API :__ If you want to send PushNotification message using App42 ActionScript API ,pass the userId and message,title and image you want to shown when Push Notification arrives on device , written in App42FlashHome.mxml file.
 
```
  	private function onSendPushClick(event:MouseEvent):void
			{
				var jsonMessage:Object = new Object();
				jsonMessage.title = "App42FlashPush";
				jsonMessage.message = messageInput.text;
				jsonMessage.image = "Your Image Url";
				var message:String =  JSON.stringify(jsonMessage);
              App42API.buildPushNotificationService().sendPushMessageToUser(UserInput.text,message,
				  new App42FlashCallback());
			}

```

__Customize Push Title accordingly:__ If you want to show default title in nPush Notification please change in  App42FlashPush-app.xml file at line no 244 and now you have no need to pass title with message.
 
```
  	  <meta-data name="push_title" value="App42FlashPush"/>

```

__Customization Push Message:__ If you want to show your own image and title on Push Notification , You have to send Push Mesaage String as JsonObject in following format.
 
```
    {"message":"HI I am using App42 Push Notification","image":"Your Image Url","title":"App42FlashPush"}

```

__Customization according to your application Package:__ If you are customizing your own Android Flash application that is built using Flash.
So open App42FlashPush-app.xml file and make these changes.

1. Add following manifest component in your app.xml file.

```
 <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />
                <permission
        android:name="air.com.shephertz.app42.push.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"
        android:protectionLevel="signature" />
    <uses-permission android:name="air.com.shephertz.app42.push.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" />
     <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
    <!-- GCM requires a Google account. -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.HARDWARE_TEST" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
        <application>
                <receiver
            android:name="com.shephertz.app42.android.flash.push.App42GCMReceiver"
            android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND" >
            <intent-filter>

                <!-- Receives the actual messages. -->
                <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />
                <!-- Receives the registration id. -->
                <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.REGISTRATION" />
                <category android:name="air.com.shephertz.app42.push" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>
        <service android:name="com.shephertz.app42.android.flash.push.App42GCMService" >
        </service>
    </application>

```

2.Replace "com.shephertz.app42.push" with your application package name in App42FlashPush-app.xml file of Sample project.
